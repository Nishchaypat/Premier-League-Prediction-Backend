Prediction on Point üèÜ

Inspiration

As passionate sports fans and betting enthusiasts, we were deeply inspired by the dedication of seasoned bettors who meticulously analyze team statistics and share their insights. We recognized the potential of data-driven predictions to revolutionize sports betting and set out to create a platform that harnesses this expertise. Our initial focus was on the Premier League, but we envision expanding our reach to other sports leagues in the future.

What it Does

Our prediction model incorporates a comprehensive set of variables that have been identified as influential factors in match outcomes. These variables include:

Home team wagers
Draw predictions
Away team wagers
Shots
Corners
Fouls
Previous match results
Team rankings
Player statistics
Weather conditions

By analyzing these variables, our model generates a comprehensive assessment of each match, providing users with informed predictions that can aid their betting decisions.

How We Built It

The development of Prediction on Point involved a meticulous process that encompassed data collection, machine learning model development, and iOS app integration.

Data Collection:

We scraped data from multiple betting apps and online sources, meticulously curating a dataset spanning a decade of Premier League matches. This extensive dataset provided the foundation for our machine learning model.

Machine Learning Model Development:

We experimented with various machine learning algorithms, ultimately selecting the Support Vector Machine (SVM) due to its robust performance in classification tasks. The SVM was trained on our curated dataset, enabling it to learn the patterns and relationships between the various variables and match outcomes.

iOS App Integration:

To provide users with a user-friendly interface for accessing our predictions, we developed an iOS app. The app seamlessly interacts with our Python prediction file, allowing users to input match details and receive real-time predictions.

Challenges Faced

Our journey was not without its challenges. Here are some of the hurdles we encountered:

Seamless iOS App Development:

Creating a user-friendly and responsive iOS app was a significant task. We faced challenges in optimizing the app's performance and ensuring a smooth user experience.

Integrating Swift with Python:

Bridging the gap between Swift, the programming language used for iOS app development, and Python, the language used for machine learning model development, posed a technical challenge. We carefully crafted an integration mechanism that enabled seamless communication between the two components.

Choosing the Right Machine Learning Model:

The unpredictability of the Premier League made it challenging to select an appropriate machine learning model. We conducted extensive research and experimentation to identify the SVM as the most suitable algorithm for our task.

Proud Accomplishments

Despite the challenges, we are proud of the following accomplishments:

Developed an Effective Data Collection System:

We established a robust data collection system that ensures the continuous acquisition of relevant match data, keeping our prediction model up-to-date.

Achieved Success in Creating a Comprehensive Machine Learning Model:

Our machine learning model consistently generates accurate predictions, demonstrating its effectiveness in analyzing complex match dynamics.

Participated in HackGT:

Our participation in HackGT, a prestigious hackathon, marked our entry into iOS app development and showcased our project to a wider audience.
